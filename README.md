# linkedlistdts
This project is just a quick example of how to use linkedlist data structure.
PS: The advantage of using linkedlist is over an array, linkedlist are flexible and their data can be accessed easily, manipulation and object reference swapping is easily executed
The huge disadvantage to linkedlist is the fact that it uses the heap memory for its execution which is very expensive (memory wise)
